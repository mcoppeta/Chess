TODO:

Replace misc numbers with corresponding constants

Finish board creation, all pieces

Since this is currently single player, we will only let player one move (facing up always, regardless of color)

Implement movement
-add selection state -> on press
-on selection, highlight tiles
--cancel w/ clicking self, or non highlighted piece
-end turn on movement

Figure out grid rotation -> this might make player two moves easy to implement
-or just maintain a second grid this is flipped, and just switch between the two

Replace pieces with images instead of a letter
